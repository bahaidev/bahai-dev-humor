What follows is humor (or at least an attempt at it). It uses terminology used in computer software as if the Faith of God were to be written in such terms. Remember that "God loves laughter", and as this is intended respectfully, please do not take offense at the tongue-in-cheek comparison... Feel free to pass this along. (It is released into the public domain or MIT, as you prefer.)

Warmest regards...

- **Project title**: The Eternal Faith of God:
- **Version**: 9.0
- **Version title**: The Bahá'í Faith

## New features:

1. Federated world government to promote and enforce world peace
2. World language
3. Call for universal education
4. A world-wide administrative System, harmonizing but free of the defects of the three fundamental forms of government

## Bug fixes

*(Note: These changes are made exclusively due either to the accretions made by our users or to our earlier releases being incomplete by design due to the limited capacities of our users at the time):*

1. Racial, national, and religious prejudices has been explicitly disallowed in this specification
2. Women and men are now, except in negligible circumstances, established as fully equal (as they always have been spiritually)
3. Slavery has been abolished.
4. The law of holy war has been abolished
5. There are no longer to be any clergy; monasticism and asceticism are forbidden. The user is expected to join society and offer the open software to others who are willing.
6. Numerous other major and minor fixes.

## Deprecated

1. Smoking
2. Eating meat
    1. As an intermediate step, hunting is not to be done to excess and preferable not to eat meat, though users are, for this version, not constrained in this regard

## Changes from previous release:

1. Obligatory prayer has been minimized to require only one daily
2. Fasting requirements have been abated
3. Ritual has been minimized (for improved user experience)
4. Numerous other changes documented elsewhere (see "The Writings"); see also "Bug fixes"

## Important notes:

1. Despite claims of some of the Project's users, this Project has existed eternally in the past, and will exist eternally in the future.
2. The Maintainer of this project has explicitly indicated in writing (see the terms of the license (also known hereafter as "The Covenant")) that until He "returns", all minor releases and specification clarifications will be handled by His Son ('Abdu'l-Bahá) and all matters to be authoritatively handled by Him. 'Abdu'l-Bahá in turn, indicated in clear writing to whom would pass authority for the maintenance of this Project after His passing: namely to Shoghi Effendi and to the Universal House of Justice. The original Maintainer, Bahá'u'lláh, also indicated that there may be a lapse between the end of His line and the establishment of the Universal House of Justice, in which case the authority would rest with the people of Bahá (also known as the Hands of the Cause of God). The Project is now fully handled by the Universal House of Justice, based on prior updates of the prior maintainers, until the return of the original Maintainer.

## Terms of Agreement:

This is a contract entered into voluntarily by both parties and from which either party is free to withdraw its support at any time (though the Maintainer, Bahá'u'lláh, will never do so for those who uphold their side of the agreement).

1. "The Greater Covenant"
    1. The current Maintainer, Bahá'u'lláh, agrees to return in a thousand or thousands of years to release a new major update, though it will likely be released under a new Name. Maintainer will provide spiritual credentials at such time to make it possible for user to identify Him, and agrees to undergo suffering for their sakes.
    2. The user agrees to prepare himself or herself and seek to recognize Him when He returns with His new release.

1. "The Lesser Covenant"
    1. Maintainer agrees to provide a clear succession of maintainers after His Ascension.
    2. User hereby agrees to adhere to the provisions provided by any of the maintainers.
